// Task details

// Problem Statement

// This morning, Raman awakens with a sense of playfulness and opts to partake in jumping endeavors. Commencing from the origin, he is poised to embark on a series of leaps. The sequence adheres to a recurring pattern: a 1-jump followed by a 2-jump and a 3-jump, then looping back to a 1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump sequence.



// In the course of a 1-jump, Raman propels himself from position x to x+1.

// For a 2-jump, his advancement stretches from point x to x+2.

// Executing a 3-jump propels Raman from position x to x+3.



// Prior to instigating his sequence of jumps, Raman has a query for you: Will he ultimately land on point "a" after a certain count of jumps?



// Constraints

// 1 ≤ T ≤ 100

// 0 ≤ N ≤ 10^18



// Your Task -You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function RamanJumping() which takes integer as input parameters and returns "YES" without a quotes if Raman can arrive at point a or "NO" without a quotes otherwise.
